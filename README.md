# Swapnaneel Ray

I'm a pre-final year student studying Information Technology at Jadavpur University. I love building stuff for the web and getting my hands dirty with code.

## What I Do 

Most of my time goes into website development. I enjoy the whole process â€“ from figuring out how to make things look cool on the frontend to making sure everything works smoothly on the backend. You'll find some of my favorite projects pinned below, and there's more in the repositories section if you're curious.

## Tecnologies I think I know 

| Category  | Tools & Frameworks          |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| Frontend   | React.js, Next.js           |
| Backend    | Node.js, Express.js         |
| Database   | MongoDB                     |
| Languages  | JavaScript, C++, C, SQL     |
